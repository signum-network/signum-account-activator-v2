    <h2 class="has-text-white">Anatomy of Signum Accounts</h2>
    <p>
        Signum is an account oriented blockchain (in contrast to UTXO based concepts like it used in Bitcoin). This concept is a more intuitive, as this is similar to common bank accounts. Other than in Ethereum, accounts in Signum can be identified by three different types: Public Key, Numerical ID, and the so called Reed-Solomon-Address.
    </p>
    <p>
        The public key serves as the origin and is generated through a specific key generation algorithm. The Numeric ID and Reed-Solomon, derived from the public key, are more frequently utilized for account identification due to their enhanced readability.
    </p>
    <h2 class="has-text-white">Protect your account</h2>
    <p>
        To transfer values from one account to another, typically the numeric Account ID or the alphanumeric Reed-Solomon Address is employed. The "cryptographic namespace" of these representations is more compact than that of the public key. To comprehensively secure a Signum Account, registration along with the public key is imperative. Only through this association is the account adequately safeguarded.
    </p>
    <p>
        Typically, the public key becomes accessible once the account owner has initiated at least one outgoing transaction on the blockchain. However, for an account to execute an outgoing transaction, it must have a minimal balance. This is where the Activation Service proves valuable: by utilizing the recipient's public key, the assignment can be accomplished, thereby ensuring the complete security of the account.
